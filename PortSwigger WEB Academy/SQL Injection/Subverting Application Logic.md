# Subverting Application Logic

## Academy

Consider an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username `wiener` and the password `bluecheese`, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'`

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.

Here, an attacker can log in as any user without a password simply by using the SQL comment sequence `--` to remove the password check from the `WHERE` clause of the query. For example, submitting the username `administrator'--` and a blank password results in the following query:

`SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''`

This query returns the user whose username is `administrator` and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

This lab contains an [SQL injection](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection) vulnerability in the login function.

To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.

Solution: 

administrator' --
